With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud,
floundering and stumbling between whiles, 
as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. 
As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, 
with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the near leader violently shook his head and everything 
upon it-like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. 
Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might,
and was disturbed in mind.

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, 
and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, 
seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way 
through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves
of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light
of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek
of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
